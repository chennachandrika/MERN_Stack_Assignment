Problem Statement:
Build a basic web application having the following features:
1. An authentication system.
2. Upload a file and save the data in the database.
3. Display the data saved in the database(use styling and themes as required).
Tasks:
1. Build a web application with some sort of authentication system. The users must be able
to login and logout of the system. You can use any form of authentication for this.
2. Create a panel to upload a JSON file (shared separately) add validations for the type of
file, the content of the file, etc. Parse and save this data to the database.
3. Create a page to display all the records from the database(use styling and themes as
required).
Note:
● Preferably use Nodejs(for backend), React(for frontend) and SQLite(database)
● Design proper database tables and structures wherever required.
● Package the entire project, add a readme file for installation guidelines. Once completed,
upload the project on GIT and share the GIT repo with us.
● Deploying your project and sharing the link with us is a plus.
● Performing Unit testing is a plus.
PS:
● Feel free to use the internet.
● Don’t hesitate to ask for help. Working product is what matters and we will not count
how many times you asked for help.
